# How am I doing? _Email-Based Sentiment Analysis_

### Overview
--------------------------------

* Two modes

[1] Interactive Mode - You will be prompted to enter a date from which to start pulling emails, your email address and your email password everytime you run the tool (e.g. analyse all emails over the past 4 weeks (this will take some time)). At completion the plot, report and log file with the individual emails will be stored in your home directory (~/)

[2] Batch Mode - You will .....


* Overall
- All analysis is done locally - emails are pulled from the server and all analysis is done locally. All emails (and log files) are (unless in interactive mode) deleted upon complettion
- In interactive mode no data is stored vs. in batch mode - username/password is stored in a root access only text file to allow the job scheduler to perform the job at regular intervals
